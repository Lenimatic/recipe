<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Jamaican fritters are a popular appetizer in Jamaica. Just stamp them out in the kitchen, take some for the road and go! Salt cod can be prepared the day before for a quicker cook time. These are also good served with a spicy dipping sauce.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>6 ounces dried salted cod fish</li>
    <li>cold water, to cover</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>

    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1 large tomato, chopped</li>
    <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
    <li>Â½ cup water</li>
    <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
